# integer_matrix_approximation (IMA)

This repository contains an implementation of an approximation of integer matrix factorization in `python` and `R`.

The code here is based directly off of the implementation in `MATLAB`, named `SUSTain` and available [here](https://github.com/kperros/SUSTain)

The scripts contain the minimum functionality required to apply IMA to a 2-dimensional matrix of natural numbers (inclusive of 0). Additional functionality is available in the `MATLAB` implementation, e.g. expanding IMA to tensors or allowing other forms of discrete data. 

We welcome forks of this repository that can expand or optimize this code for `python` and `R`.
